# About

This is the demo program in Code Bootcamp Pohjois-Savo in the spring 2021 and my first coding project.

# Why and what?

The pelvic floor exercises are important but it is not easy to remember to do them or what you should to do. I have thought what would solve this issue. Of course there is several courses etc. but the own solution would be nice.

My first idea was to do a program, which sends daily a message about instructions for pelvic floor exercise or the information that you have a day of rest for exercises. This felt quite difficult so I decided to start with a program where you can choose an exercise from menu and get instructions. The instructions come from database. With instructions you get also a Tabata timer that takes the data from the database according to the selected exercise.

The first plan:

# Where am I now and what next?

Now ready:

- html page
- the selected option
- the instructions for exercises (JS)
- the program looks like it is working right but the functionality don't come from database
- CSS

The next steps:

- solve the database connection
- exercise instructions from database
- tabata-timer for exercises
- information to tabata-timer from database

The plan for the layout:

When this is ready I start to explore the idea of sending messages of exercises. Probably I try to take the tabata-timer in this too.
